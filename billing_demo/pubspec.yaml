# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/images/Person.svg
    - assets/images/Location.svg
    - assets/images/Phone.svg
    - assets/images/Email.svg
    - assets/images/addImage.svg
    - assets/images/headerRoutine.jpg

    - assets/images/password_profil_button.svg
    - assets/images/Group 466.svg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Avenir
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/AvenirLTStd-Black.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/AvenirLTStd-Book.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/AvenirLTStd-Roman.otf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf
